How I did my code:

1-	Initialize the RNN:
Weight and Bias
Start with hidden state”0”

2-	Forward pass:
-one-hot vector
” is a way to represent words as numbers so that a computer can process them”
-Update the hidden state using tanh
-Compute output probabilities for the next word

3-	Training:
-Cross entropy loss for the predicted word
-Update weights using gradient descent
-Only predict the 4th word given the first 3 words

4-	Data Preparation: 
-Split text into sequences of 3 words → predict the 4th
-(word_to_idx)
5-	 Prediction:
-Feed a 3-word sequence → get the most probable next word
